# Adopet Console

Welcome to Adopet Console, an application where users can perform various operations related to shelters and pets. Here, you can interact to add and list shelters, import pets from a file, and of course, list these furry friends.

## Objectives
We developed this application during one of Alura's courses, focusing on applying best practices in Java development. The developed competencies include:

- Refactoring complex code with programming best practices.
- Effective structuring of methods and classes.
- Using the Command design pattern.
- Exploring the switch pattern matching in Java 15.
- Conducting unit tests with jUnit and Mockito.

## Project Setup
The application is integrated with an external API, responsible for saving pets and shelters from the console application. The API is included in .jar format in our project, which we will use for the course. To test the console application, it is necessary to start the .jar file with the following command:

```bash
java -jar adopets-api.jar
```

After that, you can start the application through the RUN in IntelliJ or your favorite IDE.
